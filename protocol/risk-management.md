# Risk Management

### Collateral

Each collateral has a debt cap (CDL supply cap). The cap is based off the proportional value of the given asset within Membrane's TVL. This ensures a large diversification of token risk, minimizing the risk effects of bad debt or a malicious token attack to the cap assigned to the token. \
\
Collateral deemed as riskier will have lower % of TVL for their debt cap, as well as lower minimum collateral ratios (i.e. lower LTVs).\
\
Risk is determined by:\
\- Systemic or Protocol Risk -> Debt Caps\
\- Volatility Risk -> Collateral Ratio\
\- Liquidity Risk -> Stability Pool\
\
An amalgamation of them all will factor into the interest rate ranges decided by governance.
