### Interest Rates

Membrane offers fixed and variable interest rates. The fixed rate is the average of the variable rate and the max rate for the asset. The interest rate range for each asset will be initially decided by governance but will be aided over time by automated risk assessment systems. __ \
\
The variable rate changes as the debt cap for the collateral asset increases. So a capped asset would have users paying the max rate for new or non-fixed rate positions.
