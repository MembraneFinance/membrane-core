# Safety Fund

Funded by protocol revenue, the safety fund is used to cover bad debt generated due to inefficient liquidations during harsh market conditions.\
\
While not covering liabilities, it acts as a living safety net to give user extra insurance that the protocol will remain solvent. In the long term, it can also be used to allow the protocol to make riskier loans and expand to unusual collateral types.
