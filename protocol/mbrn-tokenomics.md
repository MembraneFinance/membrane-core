# MBRN Tokenomics

The total supply of MBRN will be 100 million MBRN, with 70% allocated to the community, and 30% allocated to the Builders Allocation.

### Governance

The primary parameters set by communal governance are accepted collateral types, interest rate overrides, and LTV overrides. This allows the community to confer acknowledgement of additional risks corresponding to the collateral that are not visible on-chain, and therefore cannot be autonomously adjusted for.

### Value Flows

Initially, interest accrued by the protocol will go towards a Safety Fund, which is held by the DAO to be used in case of a shortfall event.&#x20;

Governance can decide what revenue flows to stakers, keeping in mind the value of the Safety Fund in user's sentiment of protocol safety. Either way, stakers will continue to get multiples of revenue as **MBRN** inflation to reward holders and early adopters.

**MBRN** also captures the protocol's liquidation fee, initially set at 1%.
