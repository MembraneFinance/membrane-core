# MBRN Tokenomics

The total supply of MBRN will be 100 million MBRN, with 70% allocated to the community, and 30% allocated to the Builders' Allocation.

### Governance

The primary parameters set by communal governance are accepted collateral types, interest rate overrides, and LTV overrides. This allows the community to confer acknowledgement of additional risks corresponding to the collateral that are not visible on-chain, and therefore cannot be autonomously adjusted for.

Unstaking period is decided by governance. Rewards/fees are still earned while unstaking. The unstaking period is a mechanism used to align the token holders who are distributed revenue with the system's insolvency mechanisms, in this case the debt auction. In the case of bad debt, stakers who earn assets from liquidations shouldn't be able to unstake and sell during a **MBRN** auction.

The Builders' Allocation has its voting power diminshed (10% overall) to allow faster decentralization of overnance and receives fee rewards but not **MBRN** rewards.

### Value Flows

Initially, interest accrued by the protocol will go towards a Safety Fund, which is held by the DAO to be used in case of a shortfall event.&#x20;

Governance can decide what revenue flows to stakers, keeping in mind the value of the Safety Fund in user's sentiment of protocol safety. Either way, stakers will continue to get **MBRN** from inflation to reward early adopters.

**MBRN** also captures the protocol's liquidation fee, initially set at 1%.
