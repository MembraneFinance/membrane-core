Technically (pool_id, asset_0_denom, asset_1_denom, height) do not need to appear in the struct however we view this as the wrong performance tradeoff given SDK today. Would rather we optimize for readability and correctness, than an optimal state storage format. The system bottleneck is elsewhere for now."]]};
